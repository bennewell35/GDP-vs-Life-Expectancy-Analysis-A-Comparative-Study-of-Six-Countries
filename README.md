# GDP vs Life Expectancy Analysis: A Comparative Study of Six Countries

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy across six different countries. The data used in this analysis is sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. By examining these two variables, the project seeks to uncover any patterns or correlations that may exist between a country's economic status and the health of its population.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather GDP and life expectancy data for six countries from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing units, and ensuring consistency across datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distributions, trends, and potential relationships in the data.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate the findings, including scatter plots, line charts, and correlation matrices.
- **Analysis**: Conduct statistical analysis to quantify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
- **Conclusions**: Draw insights from the analysis and discuss potential implications of the findings.

## Datasets

The data used in this project comes from the following sources:

- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Provides life expectancy data.
- **World Bank**: Offers GDP data for various countries.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For writing and running Python code in an interactive environment.
